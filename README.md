# Local-Services


This is a local services project designed to connect job posters with applicants. The platform includes a job posting feature for employers and an application system for job seekers. To enhance user experience, I have integrated a map using Leaflet.js, allowing users to easily locate job opportunities in their vicinity. Additionally, the project includes a straightforward payment integration system, making it accessible and user-friendly for local residents.

## Features

- **Job Posting**: Employers can easily post job openings.
- **Job Application**: Job seekers can apply for posted jobs.
- **Map Integration**: Leaflet.js is used to provide an interactive map for locating job opportunities.
- **Payment Integration**: A simple and secure payment system is included for seamless transactions (khalti).
